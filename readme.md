# Nios II Soft Core Processor Overview

## What is Nios II?
Nios II is a widely used 32-bit soft-core processor designed for FPGA applications by Intel (formerly Altera). It offers the flexibility and performance needed for embedded systems, acting as a microcontroller or a system-on-chip (SoC) within programmable logic devices.

## Key Features:
### Processor Variants:
- **Fast Core (/f core):**
  - Six-stage pipeline for high performance.
  - Optional Memory Management Unit (MMU) or Memory Protection Unit (MPU).
- **Economy Core (/e core):**
  - One-stage pipeline for minimal size.
  - No license required, making it free to use.
  - Executes one instruction per six clock cycles.

### Architecture:
- Harvard architecture with 32-bit instruction set and data path.
- 32 general-purpose registers with optional shadow register sets for efficient context switching (e.g., interrupts, RTOS).
- Support for up to 32 interrupt sources, extendable via an external interrupt controller.

### Floating Point and Memory:
- Single-precision floating-point operations.
- Address space support for versatile embedded applications.
